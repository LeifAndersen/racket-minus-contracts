racket-minus-contracts
======================

This repository contains a patch to remove contracts from your favorite
Racket installation.

The `Makefile` will update your chosen Racket installation to ignore contracts
at runtime. This means:
- Contracts will still be created
- Contracts will not be attached to values or checked

This patch should affect both ordinary contracts and those generated by
Typed Racket.


Requirements
------------
1. A "recent" from-source Racket installation.
   Clone from `http://github.com/plt/racket` and compile using the instructions
   at that url.


Usage
-----
Run `make` and follow the prompts.
For detailed instructions, read the annotated Makefile.
